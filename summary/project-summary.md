# **AI Hackathon Agent Project Summary**

This document summarizes the progress and key decisions made in setting up the foundational environment for the AI Hackathon Agent project.

### **üéØ Project Goal**

To build a **simple, locally-hosted AI assistant or agentic system** during a week-long hackathon, leveraging strong conceptual programming knowledge and AI assistance.

### **üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack (Locked Down)**

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Frontend** | **Streamlit** | Rapid prototyping of a web UI using only Python. |
| **Backend/Core Logic** | **Python** \+ **FastAPI** | Standard for AI; provides a simple, fast API layer. |
| **Agent Framework** | **LangChain** (with potential use of **Langflow** for visual design) | Abstractions for building complex agentic workflows. |
| **Vector Store (RAG Data)** | **ChromaDB** | Simple, file-based vector database for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). |
| **State/Memory Database** | **SQLite** | File-based SQL database for general state management. |
| **LLM/Embeddings** | **OpenAI API** (`gpt-4o`/`text-embedding-3-small`) | High-performance, seamless integration, and simplicity. |
| **Version Control** | **Git** \+ **GitHub** | Essential for tracking changes and maintaining project history. |

### **üìÇ Project Directory Structure**

The project uses a clear, multi-layered directory structure to separate concerns:

* **`backend/`**: Contains the FastAPI server and core logic.  
  * `main.py`: The FastAPI application entry point.  
  * `core/`: Contains reusable modules for LLM configuration, RAG setup, and tool definitions.  
* **`frontend/`**: Contains the Streamlit web application.  
  * `app.py`: The Streamlit application entry point and UI layout.  
* **`data/`**: Designated for local, file-based databases and generated assets. (Ignored by Git using `.gitignore`.)  
  * `chroma/`: Storage location for ChromaDB vector embeddings.  
  * `sqlite/`: Storage location for SQLite database file (e.g., chat history).  
* **`.env`**: Stores confidential configuration, such as the `OPENAI_API_KEY`.  
* **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all required Python packages for environment setup.

### **‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Progress So Far**

| Step | Action Taken | Status |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **1\. Repository & Structure** | Created an empty GitHub repo, cloned it, and established the **`backend/`**, **`frontend/`**, and **`data/`** directory structure. | ‚úÖ Complete |
| **2\. Configuration Files** | Created and populated **`.env`** (for `OPENAI_API_KEY`), **`requirements.txt`** (dependencies), **`.gitignore`** (excluding generated data like `data/` and `venv/`), and **`README.md`**. | ‚úÖ Complete |
| **3\. Virtual Environment** | Created and activated the **`venv`** using `python -m venv venv`, and installed all project dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. | ‚úÖ Complete |
| **4\. Backend Foundation** | Created the **`backend/main.py`** file with a basic FastAPI application and two endpoints (`/` and `/status`). | ‚úÖ Complete |
| **5\. Verification** | The FastAPI server was started using `uvicorn backend.main:app --reload` and verified via a web browser (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/`), confirming the server is running and the OpenAI key is loaded. | ‚úÖ Complete |

### **‚û°Ô∏è Next Step**

The core FastAPI server is verified and running. The immediate next task is to **implement the Streamlit frontend** (`frontend/app.py`) to build a user interface that can communicate with these FastAPI endpoints.
