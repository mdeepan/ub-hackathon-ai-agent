# Product Requirements Document: Personal Learning Agent (PLA) MVP

## 1. Introduction/Overview

The Personal Learning Agent (PLA) is an AI-powered skills transformation system designed to analyze a Product Manager's work artifacts and automatically identify skill gaps, then provide personalized, adaptive learning paths to bridge those gaps. The system operates as an intelligent learning partner that understands both product management competencies and technical skills relevant to the PM's product domain.

**Problem Statement**: Product Managers often struggle to identify their skill gaps and find relevant learning opportunities that align with their current work and career goals. Traditional learning platforms are static and don't adapt to individual work contexts or provide actionable insights based on actual work performance.

**Goal**: Create an MVP that demonstrates how AI can proactively assess skills, generate personalized learning recommendations, and track progress through work correlation - all within a 1-2 week hackathon timeline.

## 2. Goals

1. **Skills Assessment Automation**: Automatically analyze PM work artifacts to identify skill gaps in both product management and technical domains
2. **Personalized Learning Path Generation**: Create adaptive, micro-learning paths based on detected skill gaps
3. **Context-Aware Content Delivery**: Recommend specific learning content relevant to the PM's current work context
4. **Work-Skill Correlation Tracking**: Track actual work completion and correlate it with learned skills
5. **Seamless User Experience**: Provide an intuitive interface that integrates learning into the PM's workflow
6. **Progress Visualization**: Offer clear visibility into learning progress and skill development

## 3. User Stories

### Primary User: Product Manager

**US1: Skills Assessment**
- As a Product Manager, I want to upload my work documents (PRDs, user stories, technical specs) so that the system can analyze my current skill level and identify gaps.

**US2: Learning Recommendations**
- As a Product Manager, I want to receive personalized learning recommendations based on my skill gaps so that I can focus on the most relevant areas for improvement.

**US3: Interactive Learning Path**
- As a Product Manager, I want to follow a guided, step-by-step learning path so that I can systematically develop my skills without feeling overwhelmed.

**US4: Chat-Based Learning Support**
- As a Product Manager, I want to ask questions about my learning recommendations through a chat interface so that I can get clarification and additional guidance.

**US5: Progress Tracking**
- As a Product Manager, I want to see my learning progress and how it correlates with my actual work completion so that I can understand the impact of my learning efforts.

**US6: Work Integration**
- As a Product Manager, I want to track my completed tasks and see how they relate to the skills I've learned so that I can validate my skill development.
